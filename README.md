This project analyzes **customer sentiments** from e-commerce product reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The goal is to classify product reviews as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** using **TextBlob** and visualize the sentiment distribution.

### 🔥 Features:
- ✅ **Sentiment Analysis** using TextBlob
- ✅ **Automated Sentiment Labeling**
- ✅ **Interactive UI with Gradio** (No coding required to use!)
- ✅ **Visualizations:** Pie Chart & Word Cloud
- ✅ **Ready-to-Use Dataset** (E-commerce product reviews)
- ✅ **Runs on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Dataset
I created a **synthetic dataset** of 30+ e-commerce product reviews across different product categories (Shoes, Bags, Phones, etc.).

### **Sample Data:**
| Product   | Review                                       | Sentiment |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Shoes     | Absolutely love these shoes! Super comfy. | Positive  |
| Bag       | The bag quality is terrible, not worth it. | Negative  |
| Phone     | Amazing phone with great battery life.    | Positive  |
| Headphones| Sound is okay but not noise-cancelling.   | Neutral   |
